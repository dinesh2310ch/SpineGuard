# SpineGuard
SpineGuard is an AI + IoT-based posture monitoring system using the MPU6050 sensor. Placed on a chair or back, it tracks posture in real time and alerts users to poor alignment, helping prevent long-term back pain and spinal issues. A React dashboard displays insights and promotes healthy sitting habits.
